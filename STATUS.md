## Phase 3 Summary: File Operations ✅

**Status**: Complete (68.3% coverage)
**Actual Effort**: ~4 hours
**Python Source**: `sortpics/rename.py` (131 lines, 12 tests)

**Completed Tasks**:
- [x] Created `pkg/config/config.go` (ProcessingConfig struct)
- [x] Created `internal/rename/rename.go` (ImageRename struct)
- [x] Implemented NewImageRename constructor with config handling
- [x] Implemented ParseMetadata method (orchestrates metadata → pathgen → duplicate)
- [x] Implemented Perform method with atomic copy/move operations
- [x] Implemented SafeCopy and SafeMove with EXDEV handling
- [x] Implemented metadata writing (EXIF datetime, XMP album, keywords)
- [x] Implemented helper functions (CalculateTimeDelta, CalculateDayDelta)
- [x] Implemented IsValidExtension and IsRaw checks
- [x] Ported 12 unit tests from Python
- [x] Added 6 integration tests with real EXIF fixtures
- [x] All 18 tests passing

**Files Created**:
- `pkg/config/config.go` (30 lines)
- `internal/rename/rename.go` (437 lines)
- `internal/rename/rename_test.go` (231 lines)
- `internal/rename/integration_test.go` (248 lines)

**Coverage**: 68.3% (target: 73% to match Python)
- ParseMetadata: 86.7%
- writeMetadata: 81.8%
- SafeCopy: 62.5%
- SafeMove: 27.3% (EXDEV path hard to test)
- Perform: 36.4% (race condition handling not fully tested)

## Next Steps: Phase 4 - Orchestration & CLI

### Phase 4: Worker Pool & CLI Integration (NEXT)
**Effort**: 6-8 hours
**Python Source**: `sortpics/__main__.py` (130 lines, 30 tests)

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Install pond worker pool: `go get github.com/alitto/pond`
- [ ] Implement `run()` function in cmd/sortpics/cmd/root.go
- [ ] Parse and validate CLI arguments
- [ ] Implement directory walking with `--recursive` support
- [ ] Create bounded worker pool with context cancellation
- [ ] Implement Ctrl-C handling
- [ ] Implement progress reporting
- [ ] Handle `--dry-run` mode
- [ ] Implement `--clean` mode (remove empty directories)
- [ ] Port 30 tests from Python
- [ ] End-to-end integration tests

## Design Decisions Log

### October 14, 2025

**Decision**: Use ExifTool wrapper over pure Go
**Rationale**:
- Comprehensive RAW file support (CR2, NEF, DNG, ARW)
- Write capability for videos (XMP:Album tags)
- Development velocity: 5 hours vs 20+ hours
- Users already require ExifTool (Python version)
- Battle-tested edge case handling

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Pure Go: `dsoprea/go-exif` + `Eyevinn/mp4ff`
- Viable but limited format support
- See DECISION.md for full analysis

**Decision**: Use `alitto/pond` for worker pool
**Rationale**:
- Bounded queue with backpressure (matches Python)
- Native context support
- Clean error propagation
- See RESEARCH.md for comparison with alternatives
